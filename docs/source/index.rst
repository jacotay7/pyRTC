Welcome to pyRTC's documentation!
=================================

`pyRTC <https://github.com/jacotay7/pyRTC>`_ Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology that rapidly detects and corrects optical aberrations in order to significantly improve the resolution of an optical system. 
AO has been applied to imaging problems in the fields of astronomy, opthamology, and microscopy, as well as for various military and industrial applications.
AO systems operate using a so-called "real-time controller" or RTC, which is a catch all term used by the community to describe a set of software which is responsible for the conversion of optical aberration measurements to corresponding corrections.
For certain applications, particularly in astronomy, the speed of this software is crucial since the optical aberrations are highly dynamic.
In astronomical contexts, typical RTCs are required to control between 100-1000 degrees of freedom at speeds between 500-2000 Hz. 
These high performance constraints have traditionally restricted the use of slower, interpreted languages to lab environments where performance requirements are generally looser.
Moving towards high performance control for AO system in a language like python has the potential to bring new tools into the field of AO control while also making the field for accessible to the next generation of graduate students.

Main Features
--------------

pyRTC is an open-source, community-driven Python package for real-time control of AO systems, built with the following core goals:

- **Customizable High-Performance AO Pipeline:** Provide an efficient RTC pipeline with potential for full user customization.
- **Abstraction of Core AO System Components:** Facilitate support for a broad range of AO system architectures.
- **Open Library of API Examples:** Provide a library of examples for common hardware APIs used by the community to save time implementing basic hardware interactions.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Interface Flexibility:** Support real-time access to intermediate data products, text-based user interaction, and straightforward integration with user-built GUIs.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure broad usability across different operating systems.
